## What is a Case Study?
* highlights the use of ethnographic methods in addressing a challenge, problem, or as organizational experiment
* insights for how to use ethnographic methods
* tell a story up to the decision-making point, or it can tell the whole story and share what the authors learned
* highlight ethnographic methods alone, in combination with other research methods, or how major contribution w/ methods was made

## For Data Scientists

* illustrate the “who, what, when, why, and how” of how evidence is made and used in your professional worlds
 * particular emphasis on:
   * the implicit and explicit biases
   * agendas you have to navigate
   
When you share your work alongside ethnographers, we can have more informed discussions about collaboration among data scientists and ethnographers. We can also lay the groundwork for interdisciplinary and cross-functional engagements that could result in delivering new kinds of value for people and organizations in the future. The committee does not expect you to write an ethnography, or have carefully recorded all of the qualitative evidence you see around you in the way that an ethnographer normally would. Instead, we invite you to illustrate the “who, what, when, why, and how” of how evidence is made and used in your professional worlds, with particular emphasis on the implicit and explicit biases and agendas you have to navigate.

You might, for example, observe that in the course of your work it became clear to you that the validation techniques you employed, sufficient in prior domains of study, systematically miss particular data quality issues or business relevant data trends. Or you might have been involved in a debate about whether a data point was an outlier or a signal, and on reflection you came to understand that that debate was really a proxy for something social and/or financial (e.g., bonus calculations). We are not interested in tales of individual personalities (“and then so and so joined the team and they would only publish positive results”)—we are interested in thorough descriptions of real, concrete dilemmas that you face, and how you work through those dilemmas as a person with a certain set of skills, housed in an organization in a particular way, and also as a person with a gender, ethnicity, class, and other intersecting dimensions of identity. These will help us jointly have a more grounded discussion about the social implications of data science than is commonly seen in the media.

## Additional Tips

* Ethnographers value appropriate use of the first person. 
* Include observations about how you are situated in the process
* Consider the best way of protecting those implicated in your story

## Proposals must include the following elements in one PDF or MS Word document

* Title
* Abstract of 500 words maximum (not including references)
* 1-page outline demonstrating the anticipated order of your case study’s main points
* A sample passage, 500 words maximum (not including references). This could be a draft introduction, a description of the situation that might fall in the middle of the final text, a description of the research method used, or something else. We are looking for a writing sample that helps us understand why a reader would want to read your case study.
* Description of sources: Specify the methods and materials the case is drawing on (approx 100 words).
* List of references to the relevant literature, research, and data sources from which your case draws

## Title
The Axiom of Eminence - Predicting the Flow of Kinship Amity in Open source Communities

## Abstract

## Outline

I. Problem Statement

Companies developing strategies for open source community engagement need to to quantify their investment. Effective strategies for open source engagement require an understanding of the underlying structures that drive open source communities. Anthropology provides an ideal set of tools for describing the forces at play in open source communities.

### How do companies invest in open source?

Organizational open source community investment typically falls under the following three areas:

 1. Individual Contributions
 1. Organizational Influence
 1. Community Engagement
 
Traditionally performance metrics of individual contributors include an assessment of the employee's role in completing assigned projects, personal learning goals, and performance metrics specific to their role (such as sales or tickets closed). As more companies pay employees to work on open source projects, individual performance evaluations become dependent on factors beyond the company itself, often incorporating value systems that are incompatible with the company's world view.

Organizational engagement with open source communities includes board-level membership and financial sponsorship through foundations and conferences. Traditional models of charity are less applicable for understanding the value of these contributions because these contributions are seen as investments. However, marketing and research and development paradigms are insufficient for assessing the investment risks and the overall return on investment. Note that organizational engagement is often measured as the aggregation of individual contributions. While not mutually exclusive, this is also not sufficient for gauging the scope of organizational influence.

Companies that choose to open source their own code and products want people to use the code. Applying traditional marketing strategies fails to engage users and contributors. Companies do not understand what motivates contributors to engage with products.

### Two worlds apart

The current body of work is too limited in scope due to lack of research training among industry analysts and insufficient interdisciplinary collaboration among academics. Researchers are either skewed towards social science or skewed towards computer science. Industry analysts, such as the Github Data Science team, focus on the appearance of marketing output over providing meaningful insights.

Effective open source community analysis requires a combination of training in social science methodology and subject matter expertise in computer science.

Open source communities traditionally have a high barrier to entry and are difficult for non-technical outsiders to engage with. In addition, academic computer science programs fail to acknowledge and seek expert review when research topics venture into the realm of human behavior.

Note that this study does not suggest overall company status is merely an aggregation of the individuals. Additional work beyond the scope of this study is proposed for applying Group-level Kinship concepts at the organizational level.
